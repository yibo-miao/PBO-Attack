# PBO-Attack

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for Efficient Black-box Adversarial Attacks via Bayesian Optimization Guided by a Function Prior (ICML 2024).

## Method
We propose a Prior-guided Bayesian Optimization (P-BO) algorithm to improve the efficiency of black-box adversarial attacks by integrating the surrogate model as a function prior into Bayesian optimization.

## Code
Coming soon
